<p>Phishing- pretending to be a company of importance, or someone of high authority in order to get unsuspecting people to reveal private information
Flaming- the act of insulting someone over the internet, often used with profanity
Spamming- to send the same message repeatedly to a large number of people

All of these are actions that happen over the internet. All these acts are wrong and cause some sort of harm or inconvenience to the person on the receiving end. However, they are also different. For example, phishing uses deception in order to get personal information. While spamming and flaming are more direct. Also spamming and phishing are often done by groups of people, rather than in flaming where one or two people are being hateful to eachother.
