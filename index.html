<p>I really like the color green because it shows growth like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiO85zIq5DdAhVR31MKHRKpBAsQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gnome-look.org%2Fp%2F1010616%2F&psig=AOvVaw2C_egmzT-24R6DIQuaYRck&ust=1535565919448464">plants</a> and grass, and it is lively. I like the color orange because it is the color of the Tennessee Volunteers, my favorite college team. I like the color red becuase it is one of the South Side Hawks main colors, and it is agressive looking.
