  <ul>
    <li>Green</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
    <li>Blue</li>


<p>I really like the color green because it shows growth like plants and grass, and it is lively. I like the color orange because it is the color of the Tennessee Volunteers, my favorite college team. I like the color red becuase it is one of the South Side Hawks main colors, and it is agressive looking.
